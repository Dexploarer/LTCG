### Pity Thresholds

| Rarity | Pity Counter |
|--------|--------------|
| Rare | 10 packs |

### How Pity Works

1. Counter starts at 0
2. Each pack without rarity increases counter
3. At threshold, next pack guarantees rarity
4. Counter resets on pull (natural or pity)

:::note[Pack Type Specific]
Pity counters are tracked separately per pack type.

## Rarity Balance

### Design Philosophy

LTCG balances rarity and power:

- **Power is not strictly tied to rarity**
- Commons can be meta staples
- Legendaries aren't automatic wins
- Budget decks can compete

### Examples

| Scenario | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| Best removal spell | Often Uncommon or Rare |
| Core engine cards | Across all rarities |
| Win conditions | Usually Epic/Legendary |
| Tech/counter cards | All rarities |

## Tips for Collectors

1. **Don't rush prismatic** - Gameplay first, cosmetics later
2. **Use pity wisely** - Track counters, time big pulls
3. **Complete archetypes** - Focused collecting is efficient
4. **Save for events** - Special packs often better value
5. **Check drop rates** - Compare pack types before buying
