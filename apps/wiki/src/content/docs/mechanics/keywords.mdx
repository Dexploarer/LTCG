---

Keywords are standardized abilities that appear on cards throughout LTCG. Understanding keywords is essential for mastering the game.

## Combat Keywords

### Piercing

**Effect:** When this monster attacks a defense position monster, excess damage is dealt to the opponent's LP.

```
Example:
Your monster (3000 ATK) attacks their monster (1000 DEF)
Excess damage: 3000 - 1000 = 2000
Opponent takes 2000 damage
```

### Double Strike

**Effect:** This monster can attack twice during each Battle Phase.

:::note[Double Strike Timing]
Both attacks must be declared during the same Battle Phase. The second attack can target a different monster or attack directly.
:::

### Rush

**Effect:** This monster can attack the turn it is summoned.

*Normally, monsters cannot attack the turn they are summoned. Rush bypasses this restriction.*

### Vigilance

**Effect:** This monster does not tap when attacking.

*Allows the monster to remain in attack position and able to block after attacking.*

---

## Defensive Keywords

### Shield

**Effect:** The first time this monster would be destroyed by battle, it is not destroyed.

*Shield is consumed after preventing destruction once.*

### Barrier

**Effect:** This monster cannot be targeted by opponent's card effects.

*Note: Non-targeting effects (like "destroy all monsters") still affect monsters with Barrier.*

### Immune

**Effect:** This monster is unaffected by opponent's card effects.

*Stronger than Barrier - prevents all opponent effects, targeting or not.*

### Regenerate (X)

**Effect:** At the start of your turn, this monster gains X DEF.

*Stacks each turn until the monster is destroyed or removed.*

---

## Effect Keywords

### Bounce

**Effect:** Return a card to its owner's hand.

```
Common usage:
- "Bounce target monster" = return to hand
- "Bounce to deck" = return to top/bottom of deck
- "Self-bounce" = return your own card
```

### Destroy

**Effect:** Send a card from the field to the Graveyard.

*Destroyed cards go to the Graveyard and trigger "when destroyed" effects.*

### Banish

**Effect:** Remove a card from play entirely.

*Banished cards are removed from the game. Some effects can retrieve banished cards.*

### Negate

**Effect:** Cancel an effect or summon.

```
Types of negation:
- "Negate the activation" = card/effect doesn't resolve
- "Negate the effect" = effect resolves but does nothing
- "Negate the summon" = monster never enters play
```

---

## Resource Keywords

### Draw (X)

**Effect:** Draw X cards from your deck.

### Mill (X)

**Effect:** Send the top X cards of a deck to the Graveyard.

*Can target your deck or opponent's deck depending on card text.*

### Discard (X)

**Effect:** Send X cards from your hand to the Graveyard.

### Search

**Effect:** Look through your deck for a specific card and add it to your hand.

## Keyword Interactions

### Priority Order

When multiple keywords conflict:

1. **Immune** > **Barrier** > **Shield**
2. **Negate** cancels most keywords
3. **Banish** bypasses destruction protection

### Stacking Rules

| Keyword | Stacks? |
|---------|---------|
| Shield | No (one use) |
| Barrier | No (has it or not) |
| Burn | Yes (damage adds up) |
| Empower | Yes (bonuses stack) |
| Double Strike | No (still 2 attacks) |

## Keyword Reminder Text

Cards include reminder text for complex keywords:

```
Piercing (Excess battle damage is dealt to opponent)
```

Experienced players can disable reminder text in settings for cleaner card display.
