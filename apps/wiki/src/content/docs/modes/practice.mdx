## AI Behavior

### How the AI Plays

The AI follows these priorities:

1. **Win the game** if possible
2. **Prevent lethal** from opponent
3. **Make value trades** in combat
4. **Advance board state**
5. **Use resources efficiently**

### AI Limitations

Even Master AI has some limitations:
- Cannot perfectly predict player actions
- May miss complex multi-turn lethals
- Doesn't bluff with traps
- Follows consistent patterns

### AI Learning

The AI does not learn from you specifically, but:
- Updates with game patches
- Reflects current meta strategies
- Uses optimal known lines

5. **Review replays** - Identify improvement areas
