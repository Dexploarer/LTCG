Ranked mode is the competitive heart of LTCG, where players climb the ladder for glory and rewards.

## Rank Tiers

The ranked ladder consists of 7 tiers, each with 4 divisions (except Master and Legend).

| Tier | Divisions | Stars per Division |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Bronze | IV - I | 3 |
| Silver | IV - I | 3 |
| Gold | IV - I | 4 |
| Platinum | IV - I | 4 |
| Diamond | IV - I | 5 |
| Master | Single tier | Rating-based |
| Legend | Top 1000 | Leaderboard |

### Climbing the Ladder

- **Win**: Gain 1 star
- **Lose**: Lose 1 star
- **Win Streak**: 2+ consecutive wins = 2 stars per win
- **Demotion Shield**: Cannot drop a tier in first 3 games after promotion

---

## Ranked Points (Master+)

At Master and Legend rank, players earn **Ranked Points (RP)** instead of stars.

| Result | RP Change |
|--------|-----------|
| Win vs higher RP | +30 to +50 |
| Win vs similar RP | +20 to +30 |
| Win vs lower RP | +10 to +20 |
| Loss | -15 to -25 |

### Legend Rank

The top 1000 Master players by RP are promoted to Legend rank with numbered positions (Legend #1, #2, etc.).

---

## Seasons

Ranked seasons last approximately **2 months**.

### Season Reset

At season end, ranks reset based on your final position:

| Final Rank | Reset To |
|------------|----------|
| Legend | Diamond I |
| Master | Diamond III |
| Diamond | Gold I |
| Platinum | Gold III |
| Gold | Silver I |
| Silver | Bronze I |
| Bronze | Bronze IV |

---

## Season Rewards

Rewards are based on your **highest rank achieved** during the season.

### End-of-Season Rewards

| Highest Rank | Gold | Packs | Special Reward |
|--------------|------|-------|----------------|
| Bronze | 100 | 1 | - |
| Silver | 200 | 2 | Card Back |
| Gold | 400 | 3 | Card Back + Avatar |
| Platinum | 600 | 5 | Animated Card Back |
| Diamond | 1000 | 7 | Animated Card Back + Title |
| Master | 1500 | 10 | Master Card Back + Frame |
| Legend | 2000 | 15 | Legend Card Back + Exclusive |

### Monthly Rewards

Smaller rewards are distributed monthly based on current rank.

## Matchmaking

### How Matchmaking Works

1. Search for opponent at similar rank/RP
2. Gradually expand search range over time
3. Prioritize connection quality
4. Match within 60 seconds or fewer

### MMR (Hidden Rating)

Your **Match Making Rating (MMR)** is a hidden value that:
- Starts at your current rank level
- Adjusts faster than visible rank
- Helps find fair matches
- Prevents "smurf" abuse

---

## Ranked Decay

To prevent inactive players from holding high ranks:

| Rank | Decay Starts | RP Loss per Day |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Diamond | 14 days inactive | 0 (no decay) |
| Master | 7 days inactive | 50 RP |
| Legend | 3 days inactive | 100 RP |

:::note[Decay Protection]
Playing one ranked game resets your decay timer.
