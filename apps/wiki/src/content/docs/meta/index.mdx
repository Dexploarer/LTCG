## Meta Tips

### If you're climbing with a budget:
1. **Tempest Riders** has a cheap core
2. **Beastkin Horde** works with mostly commons
3. Avoid Legendary-heavy decks early

### If you want to counter the meta:
1. Run anti-Fire tech vs Infernal Dragons
2. Include graveyard hate for Shadow Syndicate
3. Healing counters aggro matchups

### If you want to have fun:
1. Arcane Assembly has the highest skill ceiling
2. Off-meta decks are viable below Diamond
3. Experiment during mid-season lulls
