The crafting system allows you to create specific cards using Dust, ensuring you can always build the deck you want.

## Crafting Cards

### Crafting Costs

| Rarity | Dust Required |
|--------|---------------|
| Common | 40 |
| Uncommon | 100 |
| Rare | 400 |
| Epic | 1600 |
| Legendary | 3200 |

### Prismatic Crafting

You can craft prismatic (animated) versions of any card you already own:

| Rarity | Prismatic Upgrade Cost |
|--------|------------------------|
| Common | 100 |
| Uncommon | 250 |
| Rare | 1000 |
| Epic | 4000 |
| Legendary | 8000 |

## Disenchanting Cards

Convert unwanted cards to Dust for crafting.

### Disenchant Values

| Rarity | Normal | Prismatic |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Common | 5 | 20 |
| Uncommon | 20 | 80 |
| Rare | 100 | 400 |
| Epic | 400 | 1600 |
| Legendary | 1600 | 6400 |

### Disenchant Ratio

The disenchant-to-craft ratio is approximately **1:8** for normal cards:

- Disenchanting 8 Commons = 40 Dust = 1 Common craft
- Disenchanting 8 Legendaries = 12,800 Dust = 4 Legendary crafts

## Crafting Strategy

### Early Game

1. **Don't disenchant** - You don't know what's good yet
2. **Craft budget decks** - Build competitive decks with commons/uncommons
3. **Focus on one archetype** - Spreading resources thin delays your first competitive deck

### Mid Game

1. **Identify your playstyle** - Craft cards for archetypes you enjoy
2. **Check the meta** - Look at which cards see play in ranked
3. **Avoid crafting rotating cards** - Don't craft cards leaving Standard soon

### Late Game

1. **Complete collections** - Fill out archetypes you partially own
2. **Craft tech cards** - Build your toolbox of situational counters
3. **Go prismatic** - Upgrade your favorite deck to prismatic

## Mass Disenchant

The **Mass Disenchant** feature automatically disenchants:
- All cards beyond your 3-copy limit
- Cards you've marked for disenchant

Access it via: **Collection > Mass Disenchant**

:::caution[Warning]
Mass disenchant cannot be undone! Review the cards before confirming.

## Crafting Restrictions

Some cards have crafting restrictions:

| Restriction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Event-only** | Cards from special events cannot be crafted until the event ends |
| **Promotional** | Some promotional cards are never craftable |
| **Banned** | You cannot craft currently banned cards |

## Efficiency Tips

1. **Wait before disenchanting** - Nerfs often come with full dust refunds
2. **Craft playsets** - If you need a card, craft all 3 copies for your deck
3. **Use wildcards wisely** - Wildcards (if available) let you pick any card of that rarity
4. **Track duplicate protection** - Don't craft cards you're likely to open
