## Duplicate Protection

When you already own 3 copies of a card (the maximum for deck building):

- **Commons/Uncommons**: Automatically converted to Dust
- **Rares+**: You can choose to keep (for prismatic variations) or convert to Dust

### Duplicate Dust Values

| Rarity | Dust for Duplicate |
|--------|-------------------|
| Common | 5 |
| Uncommon | 20 |
| Rare | 100 |
| Epic | 400 |
| Legendary | 1600 |

---

## Prismatic Cards

Every card has a chance to drop as a **Prismatic** variant - a cosmetically enhanced version with special visual effects.

| Rarity | Prismatic Chance |
|--------|------------------|
| Any rarity | 5% chance to be prismatic |

Prismatic cards:
- Have animated card art
- Display special border effects
- Are purely cosmetic (same stats)
- Can be disenchanted for 4x normal dust

## Pack Opening Tips

1. **Wait for events** - Special events often increase drop rates
2. **Buy in bulk** - Some promotions offer bonus packs for bulk purchases
3. **Focus on archetypes** - If building a specific deck, archetype packs are more efficient
4. **Track your pity** - Check your pity counter in the shop before deciding which pack to open
