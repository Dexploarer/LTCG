## How the Banlist Works

### Restriction Levels

| Level | Copies Allowed | Deck Impact |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Banned | 0 | Cannot play |
| Limited | 1 | Reduced consistency |
| Semi-Limited | 2 | Slightly reduced |
| Unlimited | 3 | Full access |

### Deck Validation

The game automatically validates decks against the banlist:
- Banned cards cannot be added to decks
- Limited/semi-limited cards show remaining slots
- Invalid decks cannot enter ranked or tournaments

## Ban Criteria

Cards may be restricted when they:

### Power Level Issues

- Win rate significantly above average
- Dominates tournament top cuts
- No effective counterplay exists
- Warps deckbuilding around it

### Design Issues

- Creates non-interactive games
- Extends games unnecessarily
- Causes confusion or feel-bad moments
- Limits viable archetype diversity

### Combination Issues

- Enables degenerate combos
- Creates unintended interactions
- Synergizes too powerfully with other cards
